        "text": "Amazing game; this is a perfect example of steams early access system being used ethically and appropriately. We need to support and empower more dev teams like this as they have shown not only do that they value their player base, but that they are willing to sell their game at a price that is affordable, reasonable for early access and great value for money. Keep up the good work Unknown Origin Games Inc."

        "text": "Great game, excellent UI design, highly polished and stable, but short on things that would make the world feel more alive.Dwarf fortress has such an insane depth in terms of weird mechanics and integrations, and this is not even 10% of that.Luckily, its still in early access, and this is probably the best moment to get the game!The dev seems friendly and responsive to feedback, and as far as i can tell they are really trying to make something greatI'll most definitely be back once more events and just dwarf fortress like weird mechanics and synergies are added."

        "text": "This is dwarf fortress' only actual competitor. It runs better, without the notorious FPS death problems that plague massive DF settlements. the sprites are animated instead of static icons. The world looks and feels more alive. The playable races are dope."

        "text": "At this point I want to say that Odd Realm has stolen my heart. Again, I love Dwarf Fortress to bits, but Odd Realm has turned into a much better experience with the potential of leaving DF in the dust. Of course, DF has some things at its core that will always be better than any colony management sim."
